title: "Building Superligaen Analytics"
---

This blog documents the end-to-end journey of building [Superligaen Analytics](https://superligaanalytics.vercel.app/) — a live data engineering project that ingests football data from the Danish premier league, transforms it through a medallion architecture, and serves it on a public dashboard.

The project was built in roughly **10 days** in April 2026, and almost nothing went according to the original plan. Every major tool choice had to be revisited at least once. This is the honest account of what happened, why, and what I'd do differently.
